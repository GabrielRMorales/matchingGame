This is a common front-end project. The rules are simple:

A series of gray-colored cards appear on the screen. The user can click up to two cards at a time. When clicked, a card changes to pre-selected color.

If these two cards match in color, they remain shown in that color. Otherwise, they return to gray. 

A user must get all cards to show in a non-gray color.
